### The Abhidhamma in Practice by N. K. G. Mendis 2016. Access to Insight

The Abhidhamma deals with realities existing in an ultimate sense, called in Pali ***paramattha dhamma*** (ปรมัตถธรรม). There are four such realities:
  * ***Citta*** (จิต): mind or consciousness, defined as that which knows or experiences an object.
  * ***Cetasikas*** (เจตสิก): the mental factors that arise and occur along with the cittas.
  * ***Ruupa*** (รูป): physical phenomena, or material form.
  * ***Nibbaana*** (นิพพาน)

Cita, cetasikas, and ruupa are conditioned realities. They arise because of conditions and disappear when their conditions cease to sustain them.
...
Nibbaana is an unconditioned reality. It does not arise and therefore does not fall away.

Citta, cetasikas, and ruupa make up **naama-ruupa** (นามรูป), the psycho-physica organism.
Each of us, in the ultimate sense, is a naama-ruupa, a compound of mental and material phenomena, and nothing more.
... The naama part of the compound is what experiences an object. The ruupa part does not experience anything. When the body is injured it is not the body, which is ruupa, that feels the pain, but naama, the mental side. When we are hungry it is not the stomach that feels the hunger but again the naama. However, naama cannot eat the food to ease the hunger. The naama, the mind and its factors, makes the ruupa, the body, ingest the food. 
Thus neight the naama nor the ruupa has any efficient power of its own. One is dependent on the other; one supports the other.

Both naama and ruupa arise because of conditions and perish immediately, and this is happening every moment of our lives.

#### The Cittas

Awareness is the process of cittas experiencing objects.

Types of the Cittas
  * Cittas which are resultant states of consciousness, **vipaaka** (), the effects of previous kamma.
  * Cittas which are causes for action (**kamma** กรรม) through body, speech, or mind. We may call these "causative cittas". A wholesome citta(**kusala cita** กุศลจิต) will issue wholesome action and an unwholesome on (**akusala citta** อกุศลจิต) in unwholesome action.
  * Cittas which are neither kamma nor its result. These are called **kiriya cittas** (กิริยาจิต). They are kammically ineffectively, being merely functional. Some kiriya cittas perform simple functions in the process of consciousness, others represent the actoins and thoughts of arahants, who no longer generate fresh kamma.
  
 #### Mind in its passive and active forms
 
 **Bhavanga** (ภวังค์) is the primary form of mind. It flows from conception to death except when interrupted by a stimulus through one the sense doors. When a stimulus enters, consciousness becomes active, launching into a thought process (**citta viithi**).
  * A bhavanga that flows by in a passive state.
