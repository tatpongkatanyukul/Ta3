At Sāvatthī.

“Mendicants, form is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering is not-self. And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’

Feeling is impermanent …

Perception is impermanent …

Choices are impermanent …

Consciousness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering is not-self. And what’s not-self should be truly seen with right understanding like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’

Seeing truly with right understanding like this, they have no theories about the past. Not having theories about the past, they have no theories about the future. Not having theories about the future, they don’t obstinately stick to them. Not misapprehending, the mind becomes dispassionate towards form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness; it’s freed from defilements by not grasping.

Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished.

They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”
